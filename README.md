# Meet a jack of all trades and a master of problem-solving.

I bring value to products by understanding the domain problems and developing creative tech solutions.

A glance at what I'm capable of:

- Developed a secure, modular, and efficient content management web application for an online education platform with over 100,000 students. Resulted in a monthly time savings of 20 hours by automating manual processes.
- Significantly cut costs by optimizing the execution time of a critical AWS Lambda function by 99.5%, reducing it from around 30 minutes to just 10 seconds. This improvement was achieved through the implementation of advanced algorithms and data structures.
- Implemented a web scraper JavaScript script and data filtering Python script to automate a time-consuming human task, reducing the processing time from several hours to just 15 minutes. This facilitated efficient management of data for a Hackerrank contest through matching and selection processes.

- Leadership (Agile, SCRUM, Kanban, Code Review, Pair programming, Project management)
