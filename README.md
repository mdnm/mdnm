Playing with IT since 2014.

I'm passionate about creative activities and I understand that almost all the processes of developing software can be improved by being a creative person.

I'm more comfortable with C# and JavaScript, but, as a developer with some years of experience I play with some other languages and technologies once in a while.

Another pleasure of mine is to teach, something that I work with the mindset that anyone can be part of the IT community.
