# Meet a jack of all trades and a master of problem-solving.

I bring value to products by understanding the domain problems and developing creative tech solutions.

A glance at what I'm capable of:

- **Saved tremendous amounts of money** by reducing the time of an execution of an AWS Lambda function that was called every day by 108% (about 30 minutes to 10 seconds) using better algorithms and data structures
- **Decreased the time** of a human-made task that took an **entire working day to about 15 minutes** through a web scraper script and a data filtering script
